# MSW-WordFreqCheck
Scores every word used in the file to pinpoint words that are used too frequently.
At present, it is a dumb program, and it really falls to the user to use common sense when writing a paper or similar, but in a large document, this can serve as a quick tool for intermediate revisions.  Final revisions should be done by a human.  Period.
After scoring all words, the user will have to use the find/replace tool in whatever word processing software he/she is using to track down words that show up with great frequency.
